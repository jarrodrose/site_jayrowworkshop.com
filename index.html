        <p><strong>[Workshop currently on hold. Space in chaos. World in chaos. Mind in chaos. Has become a mid/late 2025 project.]</strong></p>
        <p>Hi. I'm Jarrod. Welcome to Jayrow Workshop.</p>
        <p>This site is for documenting the adventures I have whilst building, making, destroying, repairing, fixing (or otherwise just hiting with a hammer) projects in my workshop.</p>
        <p>This site was only just born, I don't actually know how you even found it. Well good for you. Congratulations. Unfortunately my workshop is not fully setup yet and I feel that having a functional workshop is more of a priority than having a site to document said workshop.</p>
        <p>Hopefully I will see you again soon with a full fancy website (When I get around to coding it...)</p>
